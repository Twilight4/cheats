Maltego Transform Hub: https://www.maltego.com/transform-hub/
Maltego is an application that blends mind-mapping with OSINT. In general, you would
start with a domain name, company name, person’s name, email address, etc.
Then you can let this piece of information go through various transforms.

Think of each block on a Maltego graph as an entity. An entity can have values
to describe it. In Maltego’s terminology, a **transform** is a piece of code that
would query an API to retrieve information related to a specific entity.
**Information** related to an entity goes via a **transform** to return zero or more entities.

The only logical thing is to make Maltego more powerful by adding new Transforms.
Transforms are usually grouped into different categories based on data type, pricing,
and target audience. Although many transforms can be used using Maltego Community 
Edition and free transforms, other transforms require a paid subscription. 
Maltego Transform Hub is like a marketplace for transforms.
