R-Services are a deprecated suite of services fore remote access in Unix OSs and now are replaced by SSH.
Much like telnet, r-services transmit information from client to server over the network in unencrypted format.
R-services span across the ports 512, 513, 514 and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as r-commands.
The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. 
When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

Once successfully logged in, we can also abuse the rwho command to list all interactive sessions on the local network by sending requests to the UDP port 513

From this information, we can see that the htb-student user is currently authenticated to the workstn01 host,
whereas the root user is authenticated to the web01 host. We can use this when scoping out potential usernames to 
use during further attacks on hosts over the network.

rusers command will give us information such
as the username, hostname of the accessed machine, TTY that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user logged in
the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).
