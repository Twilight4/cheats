Linux Enumeration techniques for Red Team Operations

System:
  ls /etc/*-release      Information about linux distribution and release version
  hostname               System name
  cat /etc/passwd
  cat /etc/group
  cat /proc/version      Information about the target system processes
  cat /etc/issue         This file usually contains some information about the operating system
  uname -a               Print system information and additional details about the kernel used by the system
  sudo cat /etc/shadow   Requres root privileges to access to users passwords hashes
  ls -lh /var/mail/      Information about users and might contain sensitive files
  ls -lh /usr/bin/       Installed applications
  ls -lh /sbin/          Installed applications
  rpm -qa                On RPM-based Linux system, you can get a list of all installed packages
                        -qa indicates that we want to query all packages.
  dpkg -l                On a Debian-based Linux system, you can get the list of installed packages
  env                    Show environmental variables.

Users:
  who      Show who is logged
  whoami   Prints your effective user id
  w        Shows who is logged in and what they are doing
  id       Print the real and effective user and group IDS
  last     Displays a listing of the last logged-in users
  sudo -l  Lists the allowed command for the invoking user on the current system
  history  Looking at earlier commands

Networking:
  ip address show/ifconfig   IP addresses can be shown
  cat /etc/resolv.conf  The DNS servers can be found
  netstat -plt          Return Programs Listening on TCP sockets. Note that to get all `PID` (process ID) and 
                        program names, you need to run sudo netstat
  netstat -atupn        Show All TCP and UDP listening and established connections and the program names
                        with addresses and ports in numeric format
  netstat -lt           List TCP ports in “listening” mode. These ports are open and ready to accept incoming connections
  lsof                  List Open Files. 
  lsof -i               Display only Internet and network connections. Note that to get the complete list of 
                        matching programs, you need to run sudo lsof. Because the list can get quite lengthy, 
                        you can further filter the output by specifying the ports you are interested in, 
                        such as SMTP port 25
  lsof -i :25           Limit the output to those related to port 25

Running Services:
  ps -ef    List every process on the system 
  ps axjf   For more “visual” output to print a process tree. The f stands for “forest”,
            and it creates an ASCII art process hierarchy
  ps aux    Get a list of all the running processes.
  ps -A     View all running processes

General Linux Commands:
  find                  Searching the target system for important information and potential privilege escalation vectors
  locate
  grep
  cut
  sort
  tee
