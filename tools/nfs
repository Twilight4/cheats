Once we have discovered such an NFS service, we can mount it 
on our local machine. For this, we can create a new empty folder
to which the NFS share will be mounted. Once mounted, we can navigate 
it and view the contents just like our local system

We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have
access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder
that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS
share that has the SUID of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user
