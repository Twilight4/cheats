GTFOBins - source of information on how any program, on which you may have sudo rights, can be used
Source: https://gtfobins.github.io/

Sudo - Shell Escape Sequences:
  sudo -l       Visit GTFOBins (https://gtfobins.github.io) and search for some of the program names.
                If the program is listed with "sudo" as a function, you can use it to elevate privileges, usually via an escape sequence.

If you find a misconfigured binary during your enumeration, or when you check what
binaries a user account you have access to can access, a good place to look up how
to exploit them is GTFOBins. GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can 
be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions. It provides a 
really useful breakdown of how to exploit a misconfigured binary and is the first 
place you should look if you find one on a CTF or Pentest. 

SUID:
  find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
                List files that have SUID or SGID bits set
