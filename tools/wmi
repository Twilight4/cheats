WMI is a set of specifications for accessing system configuration information across an enterprise. WMI allows admins to view processess, patches, hardware, and many other pieces of information about the target system.

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) - port: 135
WMI is Microsoft's implementation and also an extension of the Common Information Model (CIM), core 
functionality of the standardized Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) for the Windows platform.
it is the most critical interface in the Windows environment for the administration and remote
maintenance of Windows computers, regardless of whether they are PCs or servers.

Footprinting
The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on TCP port 135, and after the successful
establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port. The program wmiexec.py from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.
