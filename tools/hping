Manual or tool-assisted packet creation can allow you to send packets that otherwise wouldn't exist or to modify legitimate packets with your own payloads. There are four typical tasks that packet crafting and inspection may involve:
- packet review and decoding
- assembling packets from scratch
- editing existing packets to modify their content
- replaying packets
