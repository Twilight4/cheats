Usage:
  sgpt <OPTIONS> <PROMPT>

Install shell integration:
  sgpt --install-integration
               after this restart your terminal

Usage example:
  sgpt --shell 'scan the target 10.10.2.17'

Usage example 2:
  sgpt --code "solve classic fizz buzz problem using Python" > fizz_buzz.py
  cat fizz_buzz.py | sgpt --code "Generate comments for each line of my code"

Options:
  --shell, -s               generate a shell command with the prompt
  --chat <SESSION_NAME>     keep chat persistence
  --no-interaction          interactive mode for --shell option [default: interaction]
  --code, -c                specifically request pure code output

Stdin prompts:
  git diff | sgpt "Generate git commit message, for my changes"
  docker logs -n 20 my_app | sgpt "check logs, find errors, provide possible solutions"

Redirect operators to pass input:
  sgpt "summarise" < document.txt
  # -> The document discusses the impact...
  sgpt << EOF
  What is the best way to lear Golang?
  Provide simple hello world example.
  EOF
  # -> The best way to learn Golang...
  sgpt <<< "What is the best way to learn shell redirects?"
  # -> The best way to learn shell redirects is through...
  sgpt -s "POST localhost with" < data.json
  # -> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' http://localhost

Passing file names to ffmpeg:
  ls
  # -> 1.mp4 2.mp4 3.mp4
  sgpt -s "ffmpeg combine $(ls -m) into one video file without audio."
  # -> ffmpeg -i 1.mp4 -i 2.mp4 -i 3.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v] [1:v] [2:v] concat=n=3:v=1 [v]" -map "[v]" out.mp4

If you would like to pass generated shell command using pipe, you can use --no-interaction (it's not integration) option.
This will disable interactive mode and will print generated command to stdout.
In this example we are using wl-copy to copy generated command to clipboard:
  sgpt -s "find all json files in current folder" --no-interaction | wl-copy

Shell integration:
  Shell integration allows you to use sgpt shell completions directly in your terminal, without the need to type sgpt with prompt and arguments. Shell integration enables the use of ShellGPT with hotkeys in your terminal. This feature puts sgpt completions directly into terminal buffer (input line), allowing for immediate editing of suggested commands.

Shell integration example:
  create index.html file (C-l by default)
