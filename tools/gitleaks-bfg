github could leak information about configuration, interfaces, IP addresses, domains etc. Infrastructure as code tools like:
  - CloudFormation
  - Ansible
  - Puppet
  - Chef
  - SaltStack
also generate useful code that can be ontained and analyzed.

1. scan entire git history
  gitleaks detect --source . -v

2. bfg - deleting commits
  bfg --delete-files filename.json

3. after cleaning it's recommended to run reflog expire to remove expired entries from reflog
  git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive

4. to not pull the changes back in your computer and push and overwrite the existing one use this command
  git push origin +main --force

Options:
  -v              verbose
  -v report.json  export to file
