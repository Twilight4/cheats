Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - 3389 port
RDP is a protocol developed by Microsoft for remote access to a computer running the Windows operating system. This protocol allows
display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. Remote Desktop can be activated using the 
Server Manager and comes with the default setting to allow connections to the service only to hosts with Network level authentication (NLA).

Footprinting
We can see that the RDP cookies (mstshash=nmap) used by Nmap to interact with the RDP server can be
identified by threat hunters and various security services such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
and can lock us out as penetration testers on hardened networks.


We can connect to RDP servers on Linux using xfreerdp, rdesktop, or Remmina and interact with the GUI of the server accordingly.
