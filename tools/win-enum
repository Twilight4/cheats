Windows Enumeration techniques using cmd terminal for Red Team Operations

System:
  systeminfo           Systeminfo can read: Hostname, OS Version, which hotfixes have been installed
  wmic qfe get Caption, Description   
                       Check installed updates
  net start            Check the installed and started Windows services
  wmic product get name,version,vendor
                       If you are only interested in installed apps

Users:
  whoami                  Check who you are 
  whoami /priv            Check what you are capable of, i.e. your privileges
  whoami /groups          Check which groups you belong to i.e. `NT AUTHORITY\Local account and member of Administrators group`
  net user                View user
  net group               Discover the available groups if the system is a Windows Domain Controller
  net localgroup          Discover the available groups if the system is NOT a Windows Domain Controller
  net localgroup administrators
                          List the users that belong to the local administrators’ group
  net accounts            See the local settings on a machine
  net accounts /domain    If the machine belongs to a domain

Networking:
  ipconfig                Learn about your system network configuration
  ipconfig /all           Check all network-related settings
  netstat -abno           Get various information, such as which ports, which connections, and who is using them
  arp -a                  Helps you discover other systems on the same LAN that recently communicated with your system and
                          shows the current ARP entries, i.e., the physical addresses of the systems on the same LAN that communicated with your system

Netstat options:
  -a           Display all listening ports and active connections
  -b           Find the binary involved in the connection
  -n           Avoid resolving IP addresses and port numbers
  -o           Display the process ID (PID)

Some of the information we are interested in gathering include:
  Users and groups
  Hostnames
  Routing tables
  Network shares
  Network services
  Applications and banners
  Firewall configurations
  Service settings and audit configurations
  SNMP and DNS details
  Hunting for credentials (saved on web browsers or client applications)

Domain Name System (DNS):
  dig -t AXFR DOMAIN_NAME @DNS_SERVER         If we can get a “copy” of all the records that a DNS server is responsible
                                              for answering, we might discover hosts we didn’t know existed.
                                              Depending on the DNS server configuration, DNS zone transfer might be restricted.
                                              If it is not restricted, it should be achievable using the herein command.
                                                       
Options:
  -t AXFR     Indicates that we are requesting a zone transfer,
  @           Precedes the `DNS_SERVER` that we want to query regarding the records related to the specified `DOMAIN_NAME`.

Server Message Block (SMB):
  net share   Check shared folders. For example we could see that `C:\Internal Files` is shared under the name "Internal"

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):
  ./snmpcheck.rb TARGET_IP -c COMMUNITY_STRING 
              Simple tool to query servers related to SNMP
