wafw00f and WhatWaf can be used to try to detect web app firewalls, and the presence of antivirus tools may be able to be detected using techniques like dropping a copy of EICAR, the sample virus that is commonly used for *AV* validation

WafW00f is a web application firewall (WAF) fingerprinting tool that sends
requests and analyses responses to determine if a security solution is in place. 

Usage:
  wafw00f -a -v <WWW_TESLA_COM>

Options:
  -a     Check all possible WAFs in place instead of stopping scanning at the first match
  -i     Read targets from an input file
  -p     Proxy the requests
