What is pivoting:
  When you compromised a machine and that machine has access
  to 2 network interfaces that was previously unavailable 
  (dual-homed device).

Set up proxy using proxychains and pivot through that:
  ssh -f -N -D 9050 -i pivot <USER>@<TARGET_IP>

Options:
  -f   Background the shell
  -N   Set up port forwarding
  -D   Bind the port to 9050
  -i   Name

Example Usage:
  proxychains nmap <TARGET_IP>

Informational:
  shuttle -r <USER>@<TARGET_IP> <NEW_NETWORK>/24 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i pivot"
                          Sets up a tunnel (no need to prepend proxychains)
