Responder - LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner
Source: https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder

Usage:
  responder [options]

Example Usage:
  responder -I tun0 -dwP

Options:
  -I eth0, --interface=eth0
                        Network interface to use, you can use 'ALL' as a
                        wildcard for all interfaces
  -D, --DHCP-DNS        Respond to DHCP broadcast request. Default: False
  -w, --wpad            Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default: False
                        WPAD is the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery protocol.
                        It's used by Windows devices to find a proxy server on the network
  -P, --ProxyAuth       Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt)
                        authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be
                        ON. This option is highly effective. Default: False
  -v, --verbose         Show hashes that already have been captured - without this the hash is only captured once
  -f, --fingerprint     Gives us some basic info about hosts using NetBIOS on the network
                        This gives us indication of what types of boxes are on the network
  -F, --ForceWpadAuth   Force NTLM/Basic authentication on wpad.dat file
                        retrieval. This may cause a login prompt. Default: False
  -b, --basic           Return a Basic HTTP authentication. Default: NTLM
  -A, --analyze         Put responder into analyze mode, without poisoning responses


Informational:
  These captured credentials can be cracked using hashcat or relayed to a remote host to complete the authentication and impersonate the user.
  All saved Hashes are located in Responder's logs directory (/usr/share/responder/logs/). We can copy the hash to a file and attempt to crack it using the hashcat module 5600.
  If you notice multiples hashes for one account this is because NTLMv2 utilizes both a client-side and server-side challenge that is randomized for each interaction. This makes it so the resulting hashes that are sent are salted with a randomized string of numbers. This is why the hashes don't match but still represent the same password.
