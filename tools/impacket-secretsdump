Decrypt the Local SAM file:
  impacket-secretsdump -sam /tmp/sam-reg -system /tmp/system-reg LOCAL
                                      Note that we used the SAM and System files that we extracted from Windows Registry.


Options:
  -sam             argument is to specify the path for the dumped sam file from the Windows machine. 
  -system          argument is for a path for the system file. 
  LOCAL            argument at the end of the command to Decrypt the Local SAM file
  -just-dc         argument is for extracting the NTDS data.
  -just-dc-ntlm    argument if we are interested to dump only the NTLM hashes
  -just-dc-user <username>   only extract data for a specific user
  -pwd-last-set    see when each account's password was last chagned
  -history         dump password history - may be helpful for offline password cracking
                   or as supplemental data on domain password strength metrics for our client
  -user-status     check and see if a user is disabled - we can dump the NTDS data with this flag
                   and then filter out disabled users when providing our client with password cracking
                   statistics to ensure that data such as: number and % of passwords cracked, top 10 passwords,
                   passwords length metrics, password re-user reflect only active user accounts in the domain.
