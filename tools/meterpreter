Meterpreter commands

Post-Exploitation with Meterpreter:
  help         Each version of meterpreter has different options available. 
               help command helps you quickly browse through available commands. 
  getuid       Displays the user with which Meterpreter is currently running. 
               This gives you an idea of your possible privilege level on the target system.
  ps           List running processes. The PID column gives you the PID information you need
               to migrate Meterpreter to another process.
  migrate PID  Migrate to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. 
               For example, if you see a word processor running on the target, you can migrate to it
               and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process. Some Meterpreter versions
               will offer you the keyscan_start, keyscan_stop, and keyscan_dump command options to make
               Meterpreter act like a keylogger. Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session.
               You may lose your user privileges if you migrate from a higher privileged (e.g. SYSTEM) user to a process started by a lower
               privileged user (e.g. webserver). You may not be able to gain them back.
  hashdump     List the content of the SAM database. The SAM (Security Account Manager) database stores user's passwords on Windows systems.
               These passwords are stored in the NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) format. While it is not mathematically possible to "crack"
               these hashes, you may still discover the cleartext password using online NTLM databases or a rainbow table attack. These hashes
               can also be used in Pass-the-Hash attacks to authenticate to other systems that these users can access the same network.
  search -f    Locate files with potentially juicy information. This can be used to quickly find a flag, or search for user-generated files or
               configuration files that may contain password or account information. 
  shell        Launch a regular command-line shell on the target system. Pressing CTRL+Z will help you go back to the Meterpreter shell.
