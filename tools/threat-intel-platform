Threat Intelligence Platform requires you to provide a domain name or an IP address,
and it will launch a series of tests from malware checks to WHOIS and DNS queries. 
For instance, after we look up `thmredteam.com`, we see that Name Server (`NS`)
records were resolved to their respective IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. When we searched
for `cafe.thmredteam.com`, we could also get a list of other domains on the same IP address.
