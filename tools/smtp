SMTP Service Commands:
  VRFY    Command can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. 
  EXPN    Reveals the actual address of userâ€™s aliases and lists of e-mail (mailing lists)
  RCPT TO identifies the recipient of the email message. This command can be repeated multiple
          times for a given message to deliver a single message to multiple recipients.

However, these do not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server 
is configured, the SMTP server may issue code 252 and confirm the existence 
of a user that does not exist on the system.
