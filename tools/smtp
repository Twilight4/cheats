SMTP Service Commands:
  VRFY    Command can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. 
  EXPN    Reveals the actual address of userâ€™s aliases and lists of e-mail (mailing lists)

However, these do not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server 
is configured, the SMTP server may issue code 252 and confirm the existence 
of a user that does not exist on the system.

If we also print out the output of the scan in detail, we will also be able to see which tests the script is running

Metasploit modules:
  smtp_version     Scans a range of IP addresses and determine the version of any mail servers it encounters
  smtp_enum        Feed it a host or range of hosts to scan and a wordlist containing usernames to enumerate

Alternatives:
  smtp-user-enum   Script enumerates OS-level users accounts on Solaris via SMTP
