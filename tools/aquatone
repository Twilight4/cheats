Aquatone is a tool for automatic and visual inspection of websites across many hosts
and is convenient for quickly gaining an overview of HTTP-based attack surfaces 
by scanning a list of configurable ports, visiting the website with a headless
Chrome browser, and taking and screenshot.


When it finishes, we will have a file called aquatone_report.html where we
can see screenshots, technologies identified, server response headers, and HTML.

Use cat in our subdomain list and pipe the command to aquatone via:
  cat <LIST_AQUATONE> | aquatone -out ./aquatone -screenshot-timeout 1000
