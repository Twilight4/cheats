viewdns.info offers Reverse IP Lookup. Initially, each web server would use one
or more IP addresses; however, today, it is common to come across shared hosting servers.
With shared hosting, one IP address is shared among many different web servers with 
different domain names. With reverse IP lookup, starting from a domain name or an
IP address, you can find the other domain names using a specific IP address(es).
