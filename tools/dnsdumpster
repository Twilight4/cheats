DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read
tables and a graph. DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information
about listening servers.
We get a list of DNS servers for the domain we are looking up. 
DNSDumpster also resolved the domain names to IP addresses and even tried to 
geolocate them. We can also see the MX records.
Practically a single query was enough to retrieve all this information.
