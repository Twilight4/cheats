SMB Client to access resources on SMB servers

Options:
  -N         No password
  -U name    Specify the user
  -L         List out file shares

SMB shell commands:
  get         Download files
  !ls         Local ls
  !cat        Local cat
  more "name of file"
              Cat out the name of the file in quotations so it can involve spaces

SMB Enumeration:
  See if our interesting share has been configured to allow anonymous access,
  i.e it doesn't require authentication to view the files. We can do this easily by:
    using the username "Anonymous" (-U Anonymous)
    connecting to the share we found during the enumeration stage
    not supplying a password
  
  Look for .ssh directory once logged in, if you can find id_rsa you can ssh in using this key
  and using username found in id_rsa.pub: chmod 600 id_rsa && ssh -i id_rsa <USER>@<IP_ADDRESS>
