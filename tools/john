John - advanced offline password cracker
Source: https://github.com/openwall/john

Options:
  --rules             Specify which rule or rules to use
  --rules=best64      best64 rule, which contains the best 64 built-in John rules
  --rules=KoreLogic   KoreLogic uses various built-in and custom rules to generate complex password lists
  --incremental       It is a hybrid attack, which means it will attempt to match the password by trying all
                      possible combinations of characters from the character set. This mode works best when we know what the password might be, 
                      as it will try all the possible combinations in sequence, starting from the shortest one
  --wordlist          Specify the wordlist or dictionary file.
  --stdout            Print the output to the terminal
  --format            The format the hash is in. if you're dealing with a standard hash type,
                      e.g. MD5 you have to prefix it with "raw-" to tell john you're just
                      dealing with a standard hash type
  --list=formats | grep -iF "md5"
                      Check if you need "raw-" to add the prefix or not
  --single            Lets john know you want to use the single hash cracking mode
                      

Single mode:
  In this mode, John uses only the information provided in the username,
  to try and work out possible passwords heuristically, by slightly changing
  the letters and numbers contained within the username (word mangling).
  If you're cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the
  file format that you're feeding john for it to understand what data
  to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with
  the username that the hash belongs to:
    from: 1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033
    to: mike:1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033
