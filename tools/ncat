Ncat - networking utility which reads and writes data across networks
Source: https://nmap.org/ncat/

Listen using TCP where port number is the port you want to listen to.
If the port number is less than `1024`, you need to run `nc` as root.
  nc -lvnp PORT_NUMBER

Connect to an Ncat instance listening on a TCP port:
  nc TARGET_IP PORT_NUMBER

Connects to the target server at port 25:
  ncat TARGET_SERVER 25

Options:
  -l   Tells ncat to listen for incoming connections
  -v   Gets more verbose output as ncat binds to a source port and receives a connection
  -n   Avoids resolving hostnames
  -p   Specifies the port number that ncat will listen on
  -u   Listen using UDP
  -c, --sh-exec  Executes the given command via /bin/sh
  -e, --exec     Executes the given command
  /bin/bash      Location of the command we want to execute
