By default, rsync uses port 873 and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking
on top of an established SSH server connection.
If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always 
worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.

If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the -e ssh flag
or -e "ssh -p2222" if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. Read guides: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh
