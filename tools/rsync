By default, rsync uses port 873 and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking
on top of an established SSH server connection.
If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always 
worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.

If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the -e ssh flag
or -e "ssh -p2222" if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. Read guides: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh

Usage:
  rsync [OPTION] â€¦ [USER@]HOST::SRC [DEST]

SRC is the file or directory (or a list of multiple files and directories) to copy from
DEST is the file or directory to copy to, and square brackets indicate optional parameters
OPTION refers to the available options in rsync. The list with all valid options is available
over at the official manual page of rsync under the section Options Summary
[USER@] optional parameter is used when we want to access the the remote machine in an
authenticated way. If we don't have any valid credentials at our disposal so we will omit this
portion and try an anonymous authentication.
