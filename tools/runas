In security assessments, you will often have network access and have just discovered AD credentials but have no means or privileges to create a new domain-joined machine. So we need the ability to use those credentials on a Windows machine we control.

If we have the AD credentials in the format of :, we can use Runas, a legitimate Windows binary, to inject the credentials into memory. The usual Runas command would look something like this:

Usage:
  runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> cmd.exe

Options:
  /netonly       Since we are not domain-joined, we want to load the credentials for network authentication but not authenticate
                 against a domain controller. So commands executed locally on the computer will run in the context of your standard
                 Windows account, but any network connections will occur using the account specified here.
  /user          Here, we provide the details of the domain and the username. It is always a safe bet to use the Fully Qualified 
                 Domain Name (FQDN) instead of just the NetBIOS name of the domain since this will help with resolution.
  cmd.exe        This is the program we want to execute once the credentials are injected. This can be changed to anything, but
                 the safest bet is cmd.exe since you can then use that to launch whatever you want, with the credentials injected.
