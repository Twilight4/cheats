Bloodhound is a graphical interface that allows you to visually map out the network.
This tool along with SharpHound which similar to PowerView takes the user, groups,
trusts etc. of the network and collects them into .json files to be used inside of Bloodhound.

Getting loot with SharpHound:
  powershell -ep bypass
  . .\Downloads\SharpHound.ps1
  Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain <DOAIN>.local -ZipFileName loot.zip
                   Transfer the loot.zip folder to your Attacker Machine (you can use scp)


Commands:
  Invoke-BloodHound –Steatlh         make BloodHound collection stealthy, this removes noisy collection methods like RDP, DCOM, PSRemote and LocalAdmin
  SharpHound.exe –-steatlh
  Invoke-BloodHound -ExcludeDCs      avoid detections like MDI
