Port Scanning:
  search portscan      Options to set: 
                         CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
                         PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
                         RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
                         THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.
  scanner/discovery/udp_sweep
                       Module allows you to quickly identify services running over the UDP, it does not conduct an extensive scan of all
                       possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS. 
  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares
                       Usefull for SMB
  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
                       Usefull for SMB
  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
                       Module bruteforces SMB login using defined password wordlist for defined username
  scanner/netbios/nbname
                       Scan for NetBIOS name

Metasploit Database:
  workspace                  List available workspaces
  workspace -a tryme         Add a workspace
  workspace -d tryme         Delete a workspace
  workspace -r               Rename workspace
  workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
  workspace workspace_name   Navigate between workspaces
  help                       Once Metasploit is launched with a database, the help command will show the Database Backends Commands menu
  db_nmap -sV -p- TARGET_IP  If you run a Nmap scan using the db_nmap shown below, all results will be saved to the database
  hosts/services             You can reach information relevant to hosts and services running on target systems from the nmap scan using the hosts and services commands
  hosts -h/services -h       Show help menu for hosts/services
  hosts -R                   Once the host information is stored in the database, you can use the hosts -R command to add this value to the RHOSTS parameter (after you select the desired module)
  services -S netbios        The services command used with the -S parameter allows you to search for specific services in the environment
You may want to look for low-hanging fruits such as:
  HTTP: Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  FTP: Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files
  SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010
  SSH: Could have default or easy to guess credentials
  RDP: Could be vulnerable to Bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used

Exploitation:
  show payloads  List other commands you can use with that specific exploit
                 Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, you can always use other potential payloads.
  set payload ID Set desired payload
  CTRL+Z/CTRL+C  Once a session is opened, you can background it or abort it. Backgrounding a session will be useful when
                 working on more than one target simultaneously or on the same target with a different exploit and/or shell
  sessions -h    List all active sessions
  sessions -h    Show help menu for sessions
  session -i ID  Interact with the supplied session ID
