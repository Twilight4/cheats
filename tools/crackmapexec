Usage:
  crackmapexec <protocol> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>

Example Usage:
  crackmapexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list

Options:
  --exec-method       method of executing a command (default atexec)
  -x 'whoami'         command to execute (-X for powershell command)
  --continue-on-success   in a password spraying attack, continue spraying even after a valid password is found
  --local-auth        use this option if we are targetting a non-domain joined computer
  --loggedon-users    enumerate logged-on users


Informational:
The appearance of (Pwn3d!) is the sign that we can most likely execute system commands if we log in with the brute-forced user.

Using the --continue-on-success flag is very useful for spraying a single password against a large user list.

If the --exec-method is not defined, CrackMapExec will try to execute the atexec method, if it fails you can try to specify the --exec-method smbexec.
